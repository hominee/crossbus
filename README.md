## Overview
[CrossBus](https://github.com/hominee/crossbus) is an implementation of
[Actor Computing Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model), 
with the concept that 

- **Runtime-less**

  crossbus neither provide runtime for app execution 
  nor access the system interface abstraction. 
  no built-in runtime, but any runtime is allowed,  
  the system-provided / third-party's / that from 
  `FFI`-binding all work.
  Last but not least, even a bare-bone [noop-waker executor](https://docs.rs/futures-task/latest/futures_task/fn.noop_waker.html)
  can do.

  runtime-located features like `concurrency`, `network` and `I/O`
  are up to implementor. 

- **Bare-Metal Compatible**

  crossbus links to no system libraries, no libc, 
  and a few upstream libraries
  enbale you run rust code on bare metal.

  the [examples](https://github.com/hominee/crossbus/tree/master/examples)
  folder contains some demos to use crossbus. 

- **Platform-less by Runtime-less** 

  take the advantage of runtime-less, crossbus is able to 
  bypass the limitation of runtime implementor and system 
  interface abstraction and go right straight to manipulate 
  task directly. Only a simple and dummy future executor(look at 
   the [no-std example](https://github.com/hominee/crossbus/tree/master/examples/no-std)) is sufficed to run crossbus. This is the primary 
  concept of crossbus to run across many platforms or 
  without platforms. 

- **Future-oriented Routine and Events**

  the futures way to execute task is retained even 
  without runtime thanks to rust. crossbus defines a set of types 
  and traits to allow asynchronous tasks manipulation.

- **Real-time Execution Control**

  taking the advantage of the design of future routine,
  each poll and events alongside can be intercepted for 
  each spawned task during execution, with which more 
  execution control is possible.

**Currently crossbus is in its alpha version, all APIs and architecture 
is not stable yet, and evolves very quickly.**

## Feature Flags 
To reduce code redundancy and speed up compilation, crossbus use feature flag to mark the necessary modules/functions, Currently here are some supported Features:

- `core`/`no-std`: the default feature, bare-metal compatible 
- `std`: rust std library dependent
- `derive`: enable `#[derive(Message)]` and `#[crossbus::main(...)]`
- `log`: enable logging out states and infos during runtime
- `time`: enable Actor to known time when blocking/delaying some duration
- `rt`: enable use some common convenient runtime 
- `tokio`: convenience to use bare tokio-based runtime 
- `async-std`: convenience to use async-std-based runtime  
- `wasm32`: convenience to use wasm-bindgen-futures-based runtime 
- `unstable`: marker for unstable feature
- `time-metric`: enabled with `unstable` and `time`, numerical timing feature 
- `force-poll`: enabled with `unstable`, `time`-dependent to periodically wakeup future polling

## How to Use 
First of all, add `crossbus` to `Cargo.toml` of project
```toml 
[dependencies]
crossbus = "0.0.5-a"
```
#### Types and Imports

define Some types and methods according to your business logic.

let's say a actor to add some number up, 
Okay, then the message should be numbers
the actor should know the result after adding.
```rust
use crossbus::prelude::*;

struct Num(uisze);
impl Message for Num {}

struct CrossBus {
    sum: isize
}
```

#### Actor Implementation

the actor should be created before using it

we tell crossbus how to create it

```rust 
impl Actor for CrossBus {
    type Message = Num;
...
    fn create(ctx: &mut Context<Self>) -> Self {
        Self { sum: 0, }
    }
...
}

```

#### Message Action & Reaction

Okay, How the actor respond when the message comes?
we should tell crossbus.

```rust 
    ...
    fn action(&mut self, msg: Self::Message, ctx: &mut Context<Self>) {
        self.sum += msg.0;
    }
    ...

```
So far so good, but how to obtain the final result 

it can be available when the actor process all messages 
and stopped, right? 

```rust 
    ...
    fn stopped(&mut self, _: &mut Context<Self>) {
        println!("final sum: {}", self.sum);
    }
    ...
```

Done. Congratulation! You just knew the basic routine to use crossbus.
the Full code see below.

## Example
Here presents a simple demo to sum numbers.

For more examples, you can go to the [examples](https://github.com/hominee/crossbus/tree/master/examples) folder
and clone the repo and run them locally.

```rust 
use crossbus::prelude::*;

struct Num(uisze);
impl Message for Num {}

struct CrossBus {
    sum: isize
}
impl Actor for CrossBus {
    type Message = Num;

    fn create(ctx: &mut Context<Self>) -> Self {
        Self { sum: 0, }
    }

    fn action(&mut self, msg: Self::Message, ctx: &mut Context<Self>) {
        self.sum += msg.0;
    }

    fn stopped(&mut self, _: &mut Context<Self>) {
        println!("final sum: {}", self.sum);
        assert_eq!(self.sum, 7);
    }

}

#[main(runtime = tokio)]
async fn main() {
    let (addr, id) = CrossBus::start();
		println!("actor {} started", id);
    let sender = addr.sender();
    sender.send(Num(1)).unwrap();
    sender.send(Num(2)).unwrap();
    sender.send(Num(4)).unwrap();
}
```
